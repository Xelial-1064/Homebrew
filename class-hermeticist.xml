		<description>
			<p>Starting at 1st level, you have attained the ability to manipulate the raw energies of the world, so long as you operate under a set of rules. To create spells you can combine different Techniques and Forms to achieve different effects. Casting without preparation is possible but much more difficult.</p>
			<p>In order to successfully cast a spell after determining its Technique, Form, and Magnitude, a successful Hermetic Check must be made. A Hermetic check is equal to (DC of the Spell / Spell Level) + Fatigue Modifier. Forms of advantage and disadvantage, or other modifiers do not apply to this check.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Hermetic check DC</strong> = (DC of the Spell/ Spell Level) + Fatigue Modifier</p>
			</center>
			<h5>FATIGUE</h5>
			<p>Fatigue is gained upon failing a Hermetic Check, as the failed spell backfires. The total number of Fatigue levels impose a penalty: -0 at 1 (Winded), -1 at 2 (Weary), -3 at 3 (Tired), and -5 at 4 (Dazed). At 5 levels, you fall unconscious. Fatigue can be cleared by resting, with short rests removing 1 level of fatigue and Long rests removing 3 levels.</p>
			<h5>SPELL LEVEL</h5>
			<p>The Hermeticism table shows your Spell Level, which increases as you level allowing you to cast more powerful spells of which you are trained in. Casting more than one spell per round treats the additional spells as a rushed spell, halving its spell level by 2 rounded up, and you can only cast one spell with a magnitude component per turn. </p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<h5 class="caption">SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Your spellcasting ability is determined by your hermetic gift. See the Gift feature of your hermetic gift for your spellcasting ability.</p>
			<h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
			<p>Some spell effects do not remain permanent upon being cast. Using Creo to heal a wound will only suppress the effects until the duration ends, never truly healing it. In order to bypass this limit, a ritual cast must take place, consuming raw magical energy, vis, in the process. </p>
			<p>To produce vis, the caster must spend a day’s worth of downtime pouring magical energy into a medium of one of the forms.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
			<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your hermeticist spells.</p>
		</description>
		<sheet display="false">
			<description>You have learned to alter reality through ancient tomes. You use an arcane focus to cast spells. and can also cast madnomancer spells as a ritual.</description>

			<description>Partial Demonization can be temporarily gifted through the use of the Hermetic Bestowal feature. Vis created to house partial demonization is shaped as a small glowing crystal, this crystal gives the effects of partial demonization, temporarily making the user compatible with its magic. If anyone other than a Shardbinder uses the mote, corruption is instead cleansed by imbuing weapons or magic with corruption, increasing the die by one level of magnitude per charge. All other effects of corruption and partial demonization apply to the user. Creating the Vis required for this feature applies one level of fatigue to the caster, and one level of exhaustion to anyone who uses the magic upon exiting as their body is not naturally compatible.</description>

When you make an attack with your Awakened Zenith Brace, you reinforce the blow with an immeasurable heaviness on impact. Your movement speed is halved, and your attacks create a gravitational tether on hit. While a creature is tethered, if you make a weapon attack with the Awakened Zenith Bracelet, the creature is pulled in towards your strike. For every 10 ft they are moved this way, your attack does one extra die of damage. Additionally, if you have the enemy tethered and they are within your standard melee range, striking them creates a gravitational fold, imploding and sending them flying 10ft times your proficiency bonus, destroying the tether in the process. This void implosive attack doubles the damage, but your body also gains one level of fatigue in shock.</p>

			<p>At 6th level, you can push past your limits to overchannel the blight into your spells. Once per turn, whenever you cast a spell, you can choose to increase its spell level by up to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). In order to successfully cast the spell, you must make an Overweave check to determine its effects. Increasing by one level has a DC of 15, two levels a DC of 18, three levels a DC of 22. </p>
            <p class="indent">If you fail the check, make a constitution saving throw of equal DC. On a failure, you suffer a side effect determined by how badly the check failed. On a nat 1 on the con save, the severity increases by 1. On a miss of 1-4, you have severe headaches and gain 1 level of fatigue. On a miss of 5-8, you take 1d6 damage and gain 2 levels of fatigue. On a miss of 9-12, you take 2d6 damage and gain 3 levels of fatigue. These levels of fatigue require one day of rest before they disappear. On a miss of 13-15, you take 3d6 damage and gain 4 levels of fatigue. These levels of fatigue require two days of rest before they disappear. On a miss of 16-19, you take 4d6 damage and gain 5 levels of fatigue. You cannot channel the blight for two weeks. On a miss of 20+, you can no longer channel the blight. This can only be cured by a wish spell.</p>

			<p>Also at 6th level, you learn to manifest your Hermetic Bestowal feature into a gate of spacetime. This gate is represented by a runed lettering, and can only be activated by those you reveal the workings to. A gate has no functionality by itself, but when two gates are present you can open up a rift that allows you to travel between them. In this rift, light is suppressed and you can never truly relax. The road is made of a cold dilapidated concrete connected by bridges suspended over immeasurably deep chasms. Travelling through it reduces the magnitude of time between the destinations by 1. A distance that would normally take a year, only takes one month. One month, a week. One week, a day. One day, an hour. One hour, a minute. One minute, one second. Etc. You can only have a number of gates up to your proficiency bonus, and can only disable them by destroying them from the inside or outside of the rift.</p>

		<description>
            <p>When you create a Maniac Hermeticist, you gain a resource called Sanity that decreases as your connection with the blight strengthens, eating away at your mind. Your starting Sanity is equal to 80 + 1d20. Your madness decreases by 1d6 everytime you gain a level in this class. If you fail a madness check, your fatigue increases by 1. If you fall unconscious due to building fatigue through this method, your Sanity decreases by 1d6. </p>
            <h5>Tier 0 (80-100)</h5>
            <p class="indent">You are in control of your own thoughts. You may begin to hear whispers the closer you get to 80. The voice behind these whispers has a personality that is up to your DM, but has long since fallen to Madness.</p>
            <h5>Tier 1 (70-80)</h5>
            <p class="indent">You become unsettled. Make a Madness check whenever your hit points falls below half your hit point maximum.</p>
            <h5>Tier 2 (60-70)</h5>
            <p class="indent">You have begun to laugh. Lots. Make a Madness check whenever you make a Wisdom saving throw.</p>
            <h5>Tier 3 (40-60)</h5>
            <p class="indent">At your DMs discretion, you sometimes speak with the voice of another. Seizing the blight both thrills and terrifies you. Make a Madness check whenever you stop channeling the blight.</p>
            <h5>Tier 4 (20-40)</h5>
            <p class="indent">Your mind is all but lost to you. Any stressful situation might drive you to extreme behavior. In addition to being fatigued, whenever you fail a Madness check, roll a d100. On a roll of 10 or below, your body becomes temporarily possessed by the voice in your head. The DM determines how this voice acts. You can make a Madness check contested by the Madness check of your voice to regain possession of your body. You do not suffer the negative effects of failing a madness check, although you do not gain back control. A greater restoration spell can also be used to regain control of your body.</p>
            <h5>Tier 5 (0-20)</h5>
            <p class="indent">You are so far gone with Madness, it becomes a permanent condition. You automatically fail all Madness Checks, and you are irredeemably insane. If you lose your body due to failing the percentile roll, you can only gain it back by the effects of a Greater Restoration spell.</p>
