            <h4>SHANDARI TRAITS</h4>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Age. </i></b>The lifespan of a shandari is unchanged.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Size. </i></b>Your size is determined by your origin race.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Speed. </i></b>Your speed is determined by your origin race.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Celestial Resistance. </i></b>You have resistance to necrotic damage and radiant damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Magic Resistance. </i></b>You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Weaving. </i></b>You learn a cantrip. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it (choose when you select this race). You do not use spell slots or learn spells from leveling. Learning spells from Feats, Subclass features, or other means aside from leveling allows you to cast that spell an unlimited number of times per day, treating it as if it were a cantrip. </p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Languages. </i></b> Shandari are fluent in Common and in the language of their racial origin.</p>

			<p>While the dragon blood that flows through your veins remains potent and powerful, it has been greatly changed by the influence of the Shandari upon your bloodline.
