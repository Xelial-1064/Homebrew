		<description>
			<p>A human clad in gleaming plate armour stares down a snarling owlbear, slowly reaching for the lance strapped across her back. The owlbear charges before she can reach her weapon, but a gout of fire from the sky stops the owlbear in its tracks. The gold dragon lands in front of the human, its eyes burning with a fiery vengeance as it snorts, causing flames to billow from its nostrils. Mounting her dragon, the human lets out a war cry as the dragon takes off into the air.</p>
			<p class="indent">Pulling the bowstring back, the elf whispers a few hushed words as an arcane fire erupts around the goblins below. Lightning sparks at the tip of his arrow, and he grins to himself as he fires at the goblin chief. The arrow finding its mark, the goblin chief can barely cry for help as lightning explodes from his body, arcing off to his nearby guards. In the trees, a nearby blue dragon chuckles to itself as it descends upon those left.</p>
			<p class="indent">The platinum dragon sniffs at some rubble before nudging it, looking back towards a halfling. She comes over and together they shift the rocks. Reaching her hand out, the halfling brushes the hair out of the eyes of the small boy who lies in the rubble. A shield of divine magic wraps around his small frame as the halfling pulls him into her arms, carrying him to safety.</p>
			<p class="indent">Scowling to himself, the half-orc looks around the darkened cave for his quarry. Letting out a short whistle, a dark dragon, onyx in colour, seems to appear from the shadows with a dead drow in its maw. Rolling his eyes, the half-orc makes a motion with his hands, and the dragon spits out the drow, a sheepish expression on its reptilian face as darkness begins to swirl around the pair, causing them to vanish.</p>
			<p class="indent">While different in personality and fighting styles, all of these heroes are dragon knights, a champion who fights alongside a dragon companion. Tough, relentless, and unyielding, knights and their dragons never give up, fighting to either heroic or devious ends.</p>
			<h4>AN UNBREAKABLE BOND</h4>
			<p>The bond between a knight and their dragon is nearly impossible to eclipse. Only powerful magic can even attempt to turn them against one another, and they nearly never fight each other against their own will. Despite this, a knight and their dragon are known to argue over strategy, tactics, or even miscellaneous things, as the dragon, despite its respect for its knight, is not quick to let go of its ego.</p>
			<p class="indent">As the knight and dragon grow together, this bond strengthens, granting both the knight and dragon impressive strength and unique powers. The dragon is typically the stronger of the pair as they develop, but will be weaker earlier on, while the knight still has to watch over them to ensure their bond can continue to flourish. Eventually, some knights might put down their weapons and live a simple life with their dragon, having forged a legendary friendship through the trials they faced.</p>
			<p class="indent">This connection has its drawbacks, however, and should the dragon knight fall in battle, the dragon too will die, as the dragon’s spirit simply can’t live without the knight. Should the dragon fall in battle, the knight can restore its body with a costly rituaL hut a few knights instead choose to let their dragons rest, and go on to instead simply channel their dragon’s power.</p>
			<h4>PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT</h4>
			<p>All dragon knights are divided by their practice, and much like the dragons they raise and fight with, the knights are known to be proud at their best, and egotistical at their worst. Two people of different practices are rarely able to get along, despite how similar they might be. Those of the Platinum Practice always regard themselves superior to those of the Shadow Practice, and members of the Elemental Practice consider the members of the Rider Practice to be brutish and dim-witted.</p>
			<p class="indent">Despite these rivalries, dragon knights are fiercely loyal, and will never betray another dragon knight, even if they come from a different practice. Dragon knights believe they only have each other to count on, as no one else understands the intense bond between the knight and the dragon.</p>			
			<h4>CREATING A DRAGON KNIGHT</h4>
			<p>When creating your dragon knight, there's one question you should consider before all others; how did you get your dragon? Did you find an egg, and manage to form a bond with the hatchling? Was it a gift from an ancient dragon, looking for someone to protect its young? Did it declare you as its knight one day, much to your surprise?</p>
			<p class="indent">All dragon knights go through the bonding ceremony, which is where they form a close bond with their dragon, establishing each other as allies and protectors. Was your dragon willing in this ceremony, or was it raised to serve you? Or did your dragon actually perform the ceremony, and you had absolutely no clue as to what was going on?</p>
			<p class="indent">Something else you must consider is your character's martial abilities. All dragon knights are skilled in combat, and how your character is too is something that will need to be considered. Perhaps they where a student at a military academy, or a guard-in-training at their home village?</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a dragon knight quickly by following these suggestions. First, make either Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on the type of weapons you want to use. Your next highest ability score should be Constitution if you plan to focus on melee combat, or Charisma if you want to improve your overall subclass features. Second, choose the Folk Hero background.</p>
			<h5>COVENANT</h5>
			<p>Each dragon knight has a different story to tell when it comes to how they met their dragon. The way a dragon and knight first meet often set up how they interact for the rest of their lives, and a bad first impression can prove disastrous to their bond.</p>
			<p class="indent"> When you consider the creation of this covenant, also consider the following: were you and your dragon both willing, and does your character ever regret the bond?</p>
			<table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td class="col-10">d6</td><td>Covenant</td></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>1</td><td> Bonding with a dragon as you reach adulthood is all you've ever known, and is the way your ancestors have always lived.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td> You stumbled across your dragon in a forest, cave, or on the beach. Since then, it hasn't stopped following you around.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td> Your dragon has always been with you for as long as you remember, and you can't remember ever conducting a formal ritual.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td> As a way of proving yourself, you went out into the wild to capture a dragon as proof of your strength and power.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td> Forced to bond with your dragon, it acts as a guardian and a protector, despite how much you insist you don't need its help.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td> Trading a large amount of treasure for a dragon's egg, you raised the dragon to serve as your mount and companion.</td></tr>
            </table>
			<h5>RELATIONSHIP</h5>
			<p>The nature of the relationship between dragon and knight varies between each dragon knight, and changes the way each knight and dragon interact with each other, and those around them. This relationship is based on their covenant, ideals, flaws, and personality traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"> While you decide on your relationship, consider how it will effect the way you and your dragon fight together.</p>
			<table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td class="col-10">d6</td><td>Relationship</td></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>1</td><td> Best friends can't even begin to describe you and your dragon, and you do absolutely everything together.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td> Your dragon is merely a tool to be used, and you like to frequently remind it of such.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td> Despite your differences and arguments, you and your dragon have come to respect each other, but your relationship is still rocky.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td> You and your dragon have both agreed to keep your relationship businesslike. All that matters is how you can help each other.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td> Much to your distaste, you actually serve your dragon, and it acts as the leader in your relationship.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td> You and your dragon bitterly hate each other, but are forced together because of the bond you share. You both understand seperation could prove disasterous.</td></tr>
            </table>
			<h5>OBSTACLES</h5>
			<p>Finally, having a draconic companion is not without its complications. Somewhere in your travels, your and your companion may have caused fear among travelers or gained the ire of a noble court. This obstacle might determine complications that arise in your adventures.</p>
			<p class="indent"> Should you choose to roll or select from the following obstacles, or create your own, be sure to consider how it affects how you and your dragon interact with others.</p>
			<table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td class="col-10">d6</td><td>Obstacles</td></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>1</td><td> The mother of your dragon companion is searching for its child, and you worry it might find you.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td> Bounty hunters are looking for your dragon, as its scales and teeth could sell for quite a lot.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td> A village believes that your dragon is the cause for all of their problems, and seeks retribution.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td> Due to your bond, you have slightly draconic features that make you appear untrustworthy and intimidating.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td> A religious order considers you a heretic for having a dragon companion, and wants to "liberate" it for their own purposes.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td> You and your dragon used to be one whole dragon, and the sudden split is strange and uncomfortable.</td></tr>
            </table>

You also gain the service of a dragon, who's statistics can be found at the end of the document.

If your dragon companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of precious gems per your dragon knight level, you can call forth your companion's spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return a dragon companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Also at 1st level, your dragon gains a number of benefits because of the bond you have forged together.</p>
			<p class="indent">The dragon obeys your commands as best it can. Your dragon shares your initiative, and acts on your turn. You determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on (no action required by you). If you are incapacitated, your dragon acts on its own. If you're absent, it rolls its own initiative.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your dragon can't take the Attack action. It has yet to master flying and falls if it ends its turn in the air. Additionally, it can't fly with a creature it has grappled.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your dragon companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your dragon uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. While not wearing barding, your dragon companion has a natural armour class of 10 + its Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p>
			<p class="indent">For each dragon knight level after 1st, your dragon companion gains hit points equal to 6 + its Constitution modifier, and it gains one additional hit die. The dragon's hit dice are d10s, regardless of its size. When the dragon is reduced to 0 hit points, it makes death saving throws as a player would.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your dragon companion also gains proficiency in two skills of your choice, and shares your saving throw proficiencies. Your dragon companion can't attune to or activate magical items.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your dragon companion's level is equal to your dragon knight level for the purpose of calculating spells like polymorph and true polymorph.</p>
			<p class="indent">You and your dragon always know the direction to one another, and can communicate with vague images, emotions, and feelings, regardless of distance to one another.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your dragon's abilities also improve. Your dragon can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1, every even level. Your dragon companion can't take feats.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your dragon shares your alignment, and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below. Your dragon shares your ideal, and its bond is always "I will protect my knight; I will do the best I can for my knight; I will die for my knight."</p>

			<p>When you reach 3rd level, you heighten your battle ferocity with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 of the Player's Handbook for the sorcerer spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Cantrips.</i></b> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spell Slots.</i></b> The Elemental Practice Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spells level or higher. You regain all expended slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you know the first level spell chromatic orb and have a 1st-level and 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast chromatic orb using either slot.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.</i></b>  You know two 1st-level sorcerer spells of your choice. Both must be from the enchantment and evocation spells on the sorcerer spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Elemental Spellcasting table shows when you can learn more sorcerer spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment and evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st of 2nd level.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the sorcerer spells you know with another spell of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an evocation or enchantment spell.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spellcasting Ability.</i></b> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since your magic draws from the power and dominance of dragons. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center><p><b>Spell Save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p></center>
			<center><p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p></center>

			You can't have more than one sphere conjured this way at a time. If you summon a second sphere using this feature, the first sphere vanishes. If you move further than 120 feet from the sphere, it vanishes.</description>
