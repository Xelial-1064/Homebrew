		<description>
			<p>Starting at 1st level, you have attained the ability to manipulate the raw energies of the world, so long as you operate under a set of rules. To create spells you can combine different Techniques and Forms to achieve different effects. Careful preparation is required for all but the most advanced Hermetic Mages.</p>
			<p>Spellcraft is your power to manipulate and control different aspects of Hermetic Magic. In order to cast a spell you must expend Spellcraft equal to the cost of the spell. Your Spellcraft equals your Spell Level, and you regain all spent Spellcraft at the start of each of your turns. </p>
			<h5>CHANNELING</h5>
			<p>Starting at 1st level, you can attune yourself to the weave, channeling its energies into yourself allowing access to magic. As an action you can open yourself up to the weave, filling yourself with its power. While channeling, other Hermeticists will be able to tell if you are holding the weave by an aura that surrounds you. Channeling too much through the weave has the potential to burn yourself out if you’re not careful, however, and caution is advised to ensure you don’t lose yourself to its addictive power. You gain one level of fatigue for every hour you channel. If you have levels of fatigue already, your current fatigue doubles for every hour instead. </p>
			<h5>FATIGUE</h5>
			<p>If you attempt to cast a spell that is beyond your safe limit for channeling, you gain one level of fatigue for every level past your Spellcraft limit. The more fatigue you have, the longer you will need to take a break to recover before channeling again. 1 minute at 1 (Winded), 10 minutes at 2 (Weary), 30 minutes at 3 (Tired), and 1 hour at 4 (Dazed). At 5+ levels, you cannot channel again until you finish a long rest. You cannot channel during the recovery period. At 6+ levels of fatigue you are forced to drop channeling. If you somehow accumulate 10 levels of fatigue, you burn out. You lose access to channeling and can only regain the ability to do so with a wish spell. </p>
			<h5>SPELL LEVEL</h5>
			<p>The Hermeticism table shows your Spell Level, which increases as you level, allowing you to cast more powerful spells of which you are trained in. You can only cast one spell with a magnitude component, and gain the ability to do so again at the start of each of your turns.  </p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Your spellcasting ability is determined by your hermetic study. See the Study feature of your hermetic study for your spellcasting ability.</p>
			<h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
			<p>Some spell effects do not remain permanent upon being cast. Using Creo to heal a wound will only suppress the effects until the duration ends, never truly healing it. In order to bypass this limit, a ritual cast must take place, consuming raw magical energy, vis, in the process. Ritual casts take 10 minutes, and can cast spells with a duration of Until Dispelled or Triggered, or Permanent.</p>
			<h5>LIMITS OF MAGIC</h5>
			<p>Hermetic magic is imperfect, and there are some things outside of its realm of influence. Spells you cast cannot defy these limitations.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Limit of Aging. </strong> Cannot halt or reverse aging.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Limit of Arcane Connections. </strong> Cannot affect an un-sensed target without an arcane connection.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Limit of Concentration. </strong> While concentrating on a spell with a magnitude, you cannot cast another magnitude spell. You expend 1 Spellcraft at the start of each of your turns to maintain Concentration.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Limit of Creation. </strong> Cannot create anything permanently without expending vis. Can only maintain one magical beast at a time, and spells to create or control beasts require concentration.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Limit of Depth. </strong> A creature can only be affected by one buff and debuff, and duration magnitude spell inflicted by Hermeticism at any given time.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Limit of Energy. </strong> Cannot restore one’s own physical energy.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Limit of Healing. </strong> Without access to ritual magic, Creo spells that attempt to heal a wound instead grant temporary hit points that last until the duration ends. Granting temporary hit points in this way does not scale with spell level increases to magnitude.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Limit of the Infernal. </strong> Detection magic is useless against demons(reveals only what that demon wants you to believe).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Limit of Longevity. </strong> Duration spells with magnitude do not scale with spell level increases to magnitude.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Limit of Resistance. </strong> A creature under the effects of a debuff or duration magnitude spell can repeat their saving throw to dispel the effect at the start of each of their turns.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Limit of the Soul. </strong> Cannot create an immortal soul.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Limit of Time. </strong> Cannot alter passage of time. Cannot affect past or directly affect future.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Limit of True Feeling. </strong> Some strong instances of love/friendship/faith cannot be altered.</p>
			<h5>VIS</h5>
			<p>Vis is the raw magical energy of any given Hermetic form, and can be used to strengthen spell casting. To produce vis, the caster must perform an 8 hour ritual pouring magical energy into a medium of one of the forms. If you are proficient in the form you are creating you create a number of vis equal to your proficiency bonus, otherwise you only create 1. If you cast a spell of a form of which you have Vis prepared, you can increase its spell level by 1 per each Vis consumed in the casting, to a maximum of your proficiency bonus.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
			<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your hermeticist spells.</p>

In addition to being fatigued, whenever you fail a Madness check, roll a d100. On a roll of 10 or below, your body becomes temporarily possessed by the voice in your head. The DM determines how this voice acts. You can make a Madness check contested by the Madness check of your voice to regain possession of your body. You do not suffer the negative effects of failing a madness check, although you do not gain back control. A greater restoration spell can also be used to regain control of your body.</p>
