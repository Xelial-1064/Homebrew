			<p>Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.</p>
			<p class="indent">Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond.</p>
			<p class="indent">Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left.</p>
			<p class="indent">Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.</p>
			<h4>SCHOLARS OF THE ARCANE</h4>
			<p>Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.</p>
			<p class="indent">Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.</p>
			<h4>THE LURE OF KNOWLEDGE</h4>
			<p>Wizards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.</p>
			<p class="indent">But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A WIZARD </h4>
			<p>Creating a wizard character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic?</p>
			<p class="indent">What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard? Perhaps you’re simply eager to put your newfound magical skills to the test in the face of danger.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 1st level, you have attained the ability to manipulate the raw energies of the world, so long as you operate under a set of rules. To create spells you can combine different Techniques and Forms to achieve different effects. You have a certain number of prepared spells in this way that you can create during a long rest. Casting without preparation is possible but much more difficult.</p>
			<p>In order to successfully cast a spell after determining its Technique, Form, and Magnitude, a successful Hermetic Check must be made. A Hermetic check is equal to (DC of the Spell / Spell Level) + Fatigue Modifier. Forms of advantage and disadvantage, or other modifiers do not apply to this check.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Hermetic check DC</strong> = (DC of the Spell/ Spell Level) + Fatigue Modifier</p>
			</center>
			<h5>FATIGUE</h5>
			<p>Fatigue is gained upon failing a Hermetic Check,  as the failed spell backfires. The total number of Fatigue levels impose a penalty: -0 at 1 (Winded), -1 at 2 (Weary), -3 at 3 (Tired), and -5 at 4 (Dazed). At 5 levels, you fall unconscious. Fatigue can be cleared by resting, with short rests removing 1 level of fatigue and Long rests removing 3 levels.</p>
			<h5>SPELL LEVEL</h5>
			<p>The Hermeticism table shows your Spell Level, which increases as you level allowing you to cast more powerful spells of which you are trained in. Casting more than one spell per round treats the additional spells as a rushed spell, doubling its cost. </p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<h5 class="caption">SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Your spellcasting ability is determined by your hermetic gift. See the Gift feature of your hermetic gift for your spellcasting ability.</p>
			<h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
			<p>Some spell effects do not remain permanent upon being cast. Using Creo to heal a wound will only suppress the effects until the duration ends, never truly healing it. In order to bypass this limit, a ritual cast must take place, consuming raw magical energy, vis, in the process. </p>
			<p>To produce vis, the caster must spend a day’s worth of downtime pouring magical energy into a medium of one of the forms.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
			<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your hermeticist spells.</p>
		</description>
		<sheet display="false">
			<description>You have learned to alter reality through ancient tomes. You use an arcane focus to cast spells. and can also cast madnomancer spells as a ritual.</description>
