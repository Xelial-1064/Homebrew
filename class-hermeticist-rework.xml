		<description>
			<p>Starting at 1st level, you have attained the ability to manipulate the raw energies of the world, so long as you operate under a set of rules. To create spells you can combine different Techniques and Forms to achieve different effects. Careful preparation is required for all but the most advanced Hermetic Mages.</p>
			<p>In order to successfully cast a spell you have a Spell Crafting total equal to your Spell Level. Each property of a spell has a cost, and you can only cast spells within your Spell Crafting Total. </p>
			<h5>CHANNELING</h5>
			<p>You can attune yourself to the weave, channeling its energies into yourself allowing access to magic. As an action you can open yourself up to the weave, filling yourself with its power. While channeling, other Hermeticists will be able to tell if you are holding the weave by an aura that surrounds you. Channeling too much through the weave has the potential to burn yourself out if you’re not careful, however, and caution is advised to ensure you don’t lose yourself to its addictive power. You gain one level of fatigue for every hour you channel without break. </p>
			<h5>FATIGUE</h5>
			<p>If you attempt to cast a spell that is beyond your safe limit for channeling, you gain one level of fatigue for every level past your Spell Craft limit. The more fatigue you have, the longer you will need to take a break to recover before channeling again. 1 minute at 1 (Winded), 10 minutes at 2 (Weary), 30 minutes at 3 (Tired), and 1 hour at 4 (Dazed). At 5+ levels, you fall unconscious for 1d4 + Fatigue hours. If you attempt to channel while you are in the recovery period, you must spend one fatigue to do so. </p>
			<h5>SPELL LEVEL</h5>
			<p>The Hermeticism table shows your Spell Level, which increases as you level, allowing you to cast more powerful spells of which you are trained in. You can only cast one spell with a magnitude component per turn. </p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<h5 class="caption">SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Your spellcasting ability is determined by your hermetic study. See the Study feature of your hermetic study for your spellcasting ability.</p>
			<h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
			<p>Some spell effects do not remain permanent upon being cast. Using Creo to heal a wound will only suppress the effects until the duration ends, never truly healing it. In order to bypass this limit, a ritual cast must take place, consuming raw magical energy, vis, in the process. Ritual casts take 10 minutes, and can cast spells with a duration of Until Dispelled or Triggered, or Permanent.</p>
			<h5>VIS</h5>
			<p>Vis is the raw magical energy of any given Hermetic form, and can be used to strengthen spell casting. To produce vis, the caster must perform an 8 hour ritual pouring magical energy into a medium of one of the forms. If you are proficient in the form you are creating you create a number of vis equal to your proficiency bonus, otherwise you only create 1. If you cast a spell of a form of which you have Vis prepared, you can increase its spell level by 1 per each Vis consumed in the casting. If you are fatigued you can substitute vis for the fatigue cost to begin channeling.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
			<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your hermeticist spells.</p>

You cannot extract the shadows of creatures with a challenge rating higher than half your level (minimum of 1). The maximum number of shadows that you can extract is equal to your level + spell level. As an action you can touch a corpse and attempt to extract its shadow. You get three tries per corpse. Make a charisma check with the DC set by 10 + the creature's challenge rating + the creature's charisma score or wisdom score, whichever is higher. You are considered proficient in this check. On success, the creature is absorbed into your shadow. If this would put you over the number of shadows you can store, then you can dismiss one summon from your shadow. A dismissed summon can never be resummoned. A creature that has legendary resistance(s) can use them to resist extraction. A creature can also choose not to resist the call, causing an automatic success on the extraction check. The creature's statistics are the original statistics it had, with the shadow template applied. The shadow template is detailed at the end of the class description. At your DM's discretion, this feature may not work on undead. </p>

If a creature already had vulnerability to radiant damage, it now gains the sunlight sensitivity feature. Active summons share the same hp pool as the caster, but cannot take more damage in one attack than their max hit points. If they take damage equal to or greater than their maximum hit points, they dissipate until the start of your next turn. If a summon takes enough damage to drop the summoner below one health, all summons are returned to your shadow and you drop to 1 hit point instead. </p>
